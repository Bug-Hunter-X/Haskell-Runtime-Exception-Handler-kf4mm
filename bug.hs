This Haskell code suffers from a common issue: it uses `undefined` without proper handling, leading to runtime exceptions.

```haskell
import Data.Maybe

processMaybe :: Maybe Int -> Int
processMaybe x = fromMaybe 0 x

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let result = processMaybe Nothing
  print result -- This will print 0
  
  let result2 = processMaybe (Just 5) -- This will print 5
  print result2

  let result3 = processMaybe undefined -- This will cause an exception!
  print result3
```
