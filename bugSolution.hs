The solution is to improve the `processMaybe` function to handle the `undefined` case.  We can use pattern matching to gracefully handle this:

```haskell
import Data.Maybe

processMaybe :: Maybe Int -> Int
processMaybe Nothing = 0
processMaybe (Just x) = x
processMaybe undefined = 0 -- Handle undefined case gracefully

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let result = processMaybe Nothing
  print result -- Prints 0
  
  let result2 = processMaybe (Just 5)
  print result2 -- Prints 5
  
  let result3 = processMaybe undefined
  print result3 -- Prints 0 (now handles undefined)
```

This revised version explicitly handles the `undefined` case, returning 0 and avoiding the runtime exception.  Alternative solutions might involve using `maybe` function or other conditional logic to handle possible undefined inputs.
